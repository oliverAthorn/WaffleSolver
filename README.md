# WaffleSolver

A simple Waffle Solver for the online puzzle game, Waffle: https://wafflegame.net/

I play Waffle everyday and it got me thinking if I could automate the process of generating the words. I intend to refactor and add addittional functionality to this application: 

# My todo List

1) SqlLite for storage of 5 letter US dictionary words. 
2) Utilisation of CSS selectors to grab each new days letters automatically. 
3) Potentially use Selenium (or another web-driver) to swap the letters into the correct position. 

## Usage

```c
Should you be interested in using my Waffle Solver to solve all your Waffles, that's very easy. 

All you need to do is pull the repository and run the app as console application. 
```
